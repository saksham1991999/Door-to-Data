[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## üßê Inspiration
We have heard of the news about our data being used and sold to companies without our permission. What if we have a way to see how and what data are being used and tracked through our social media accounts and from multiple different platforms such as YouTube and Google. We came up with a solution to collect and visualize our own data in an application and have management over our own data.

## üëÄ What it does
Door to Data is an application that lets the user take the driver's seat of their own data. The application first collects the user's data from multiple companies such as Googe, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Spotify, etc. Then it shows the statistics of the data being collected by those companies in a user-friendly dashboard such as how many times the user's location has been tracked by the company.

The user can also manage their ads, restrict access on their data and unsubscribe from all the mailing subscription that they might even forget they have it subscribed. With Door to Data, the user has complete control over their own data and manages them freely. 

## üõ† How we built it
We use Flutter for our frontend to build a crossed platform applications, iOS, Android, and Web Application, and use Python to handle our backend to fetch data from the user's account logins. 

## ‚ùå Challenges we ran into
This is our first time using Flutter to build an application. We have timezone differences and face the problem of different Flutter versions being used. Some Flutter dependencies are not supportive of the latest version of Flutter 2.0.

## ‚úåÔ∏è Accomplishments that we're proud of
Overcome the timezone difference and learn something new to create a project. 

## ü§ì What we learned
We have learned Flutter and Python. 

## ‚è≠ What's next for Door to Data
Add more companies to the list where the user can get their data to show it on the application and have control over them.
